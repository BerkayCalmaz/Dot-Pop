This is a Match 3 game that I am currently working on to improve my Unity skills. I follow various guides and tutorials while trying to add the features in my mind. The end goal is to have a game that is as polished as possible so that I can learn how Unity operates and showcase my abilities.

Please note that while some sections meet my standards of clean coding, this project is currently a work in progress. Occasionally, the code may contain "magic numbers," TODOs, or personal comments :). Nonetheless, I endeavor to maintain a stable version of the project on my GitHub repository.
