This is a Match 3 game that I am currently working on to improve my Unity skills. I follow various guides and tutorials while trying to add the features in my mind. The end goal is to have a game that is as polished as possible so that I can learn how Unity operates and showcase my abilities.

Don't forget that this is a work in progress so from time to time, the code might include "magic numbers", TODOs or just comments for myself. However, I am trying to keep a stable version on my GitHub.
